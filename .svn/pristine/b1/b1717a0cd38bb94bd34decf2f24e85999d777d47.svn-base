Widget for list popular content (pages, posts, custom post types) – based on Statify plugin.

== Description ==

The *Statify Widget* shows the most popular content from [Statify](http://wordpress.org/plugins/statify/) plugin made by pluginkollektiv. Fast and clear!

= What is Statify? =

Statify is a plugin for visitor statistics with emphasis on privacy, transparency and clarity.

**Note**: This widget only works with the main plugin [Statify](http://wordpress.org/plugins/statify/).

= Features =

* **Popular Posts**: Sum up all view from Statify and put it together in a widget
* **Shortcodes**: The counter for each post/page can be put everywhere
* **Custom Post Types**: Statify Widget supports custom post types, that can be displayed
* **Intelligent summary**: Once there are different paths to a content, the widget adds them together 
* **Period Selectable**: It is possible to choose an individual daily period for the post popular content
* **New: Custom Widget Template**: Now, you can design your own Widget Template (see FAQ)

= Shortcode =

The shortcode `[statify-count]` can be used to display calls to the current post or page. With the options "prefix" and "suffix" displayed texts can be checked before (prefix) and after (suffix) the calls:

`[statify-count prefix="Total " suffix=" calls." days="8"]`

Parameter:

* `prefix`: Sentence before views
* `suffix`: Sentence after views
* `days`: Inteval for view statistics

Result: A total of 243 views.

= Widget Settings =

The following settings can be made in the widget:

* Title
* Content Type (Default: post )
* Category (when content type post is select)
* Amount (default: 5)
* Show calls (default: No)
* Custom text (Replace variable for views: %VIEWS%)
* Number of past days

== Installation ==

1. Install the "[Statify](http://wordpress.org/plugins/statify/)" by pluginkollektiv.
1. Install Plugin "Statify Widget" and activate it.
1. Activate the *Popular Post Widget* under widgets.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Error: The widget does not find any entries =

Statify has not added statistics yet. Wait some days to collect some statistics by Statify.

= Show pages and posts together =

Yes! Since 1.1.4 that works. Just in the content type widget: select "Pages and posts". He then displays the default content types "post" and "page" together.

= Show views in pages and posts =

This is possible with the shortcode and theme functions. Specifying a prefix and suffix is ​​not mandatory:

`[statify-count prefix ="Total" suffix ="calls." days="8"]`

The total views of the page :

`[statify-count-sum prefix="Total" suffix="calls."]`

= I do not have static page as homepage =

No problem. A pseudo "Frontpage" (with views) entry appears.

= I changed the permalink structure =

This changes nothing. The plugin takes every Statify entry and adds it together sensibly.

= Change design (CSS) =

Just use these CSS classes:
* `.statify-widget-list {...}`
* `.statify-widget-element {...}`
* `.statify-widget-link {...}`

= Change list from numeric to points =

If you want to change the list of contents (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) to bullets, just add the following to the CSS:

`.statify-widget-element {
    list-style-type: circle;
} `

= ADVANCED: Change Widget Template =

Since 1.3.5 it is possible to customize the Widget Template. Simply create your own template in the `functions.php` of the theme directory. You can use the [WP Post Object](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_post/) in the template. To make your template work, you have to hook the function after that.

Example:

`
function custom_widget_template($posts) {
?>
	<?php if ( empty($posts) ): ?>
	<p><?php __( 'There are no posts yet.','statify-widget' ) ?></p>
	<?php else: ?>

	<ol class="statify-widget-list">
		<?php foreach ($posts as $post): ?>
		<li class="statify-widget-element">
			<a class="statify-widget-link" title="<?php echo $post->post_title ?>" href="<?php echo $post->post_permalink ?>"><?php echo $post->post_title ?></a> <span>(<?php echo $post->post_suffix ?>)</span>
		</li>
		<?php endforeach; ?>
	</ol>

	<?php endif; ?>
<?php }

add_filter( 'statify_widget__template', 'custom_widget_template', 999 );
`

= ADVANCED: Return all posts as WP Query =

For example put this in your theme:

`
<?php
    if(function_exists('statify_popular_posts')) {
        statify_popular_posts(
            $amount = 5,
            $days = 30,
            $post_type = 'post',
            $post_category = 0
        );
    }
?>
`

Properties

* `$days` Range of days for statictics (0 = all days)
* `$amount` Amount of posts
* `$post_type` Post type ("post", "page", ...)
* `$post_category` Category of the post, if post type is choosen
